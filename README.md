# Journal-Posting
Any user from Accounting Department of a company will post a Journal along with associated line items. After going through the approval process by the Accounting Department, the journal will be posted in the database. In case the Transaction is needed to be reversed, there is a Reversal button in the Transaction detail page to reverse the Transaction in to a negative Journal.
